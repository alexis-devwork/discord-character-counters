## Categories

Counters are grouped by the following categories in output:

- **tempers**
- **reknown**
- **general**
- **health**
- **items**
- **other**
- **projects**
- **xp**

---

## Health System

- Health trackers store a list of health levels (Bruised, Hurt, Injured, Wounded, Mauled, Crippled, Incapacitated).
- Damage is tracked as a list of types (Bashing, Lethal, Aggravated).
- Damage and healing commands update the damage list, respecting health track limits.
- Normal and chimerical health trackers are displayed side by side when both exist.

### Health Display

Health is displayed using emoji:
- ‚óºÔ∏è - Empty/undamaged health level
- üáß - Bashing damage
- üá± - Lethal damage
- üá¶ - Aggravated damage

When both normal and chimerical health are present, a header row with üü¶ üá® indicates the columns.

---

## Counter Types

- **Single number**: Basic counter with temp and perm values
- **Perm is maximum**: Counter where temp can't exceed perm (used for willpower, etc.)
- **Perm is maximum with bedlam**: Counter with additional bedlam value (used for changeling willpower)
- **Perm not maximum**: Counter where temp and perm are tracked separately

---

## Autocomplete

All commands that take a character, counter, category, or splat use Discord dropdown/autocomplete for fast selection.

---

## Notes

- All data is per-user; users cannot see or edit other users' characters or counters.
- Removing a character also removes all associated counters and health trackers.
- All limits (max characters, counters, field lengths) are configurable in `.env`.
- Health display automatically pairs normal and chimerical health when both exist.
