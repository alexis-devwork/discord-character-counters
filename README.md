## Getting Started

Begin by adding a character using one of the following commands:

- `/configav add character_sorc <character> <willpower> <mana>`  
  Add a Sorcerer character with willpower and mana counters, and a normal health tracker.
- `/configav add character_vampire <character> <blood_pool> <willpower>`  
  Add a Vampire character with blood pool and willpower counters, and a normal health tracker.
- `/configav add character_changeling <character> <willpower_fae> <glamour> <banality>`  
  Add a Changeling character with willpower_fae, glamour, nightmare (default 0), banality counters, and both normal and chimerical health trackers.
- `/configav add character_fera <character> <willpower> <gnosis> <rage> <glory> <honor> <wisdom> [honor_replacement] [glory_replacement] [wisdom_replacement]`  
  Add a Fera character with all relevant counters and a normal health tracker.

Once you have a character, use the essential `/avct` commands for gameplay:

- `/avct show <character> [public=False]`  
  Show all counters and health for a character. Set `public` to True to make visible to everyone.
- `/avct plus <character> <counter> [points=1]`  
  Add points to a counter.
- `/avct minus <character> <counter> [points=1]`  
  Remove points from a counter.
- `/avct damage <character> <damage_type> <levels> [chimerical=False]`  
  Add damage to a health tracker. Defaults to normal health, set `chimerical` to True for chimerical damage.
- `/avct heal <character> <levels> [chimerical=False]`  
  Heal damage from a health tracker. Defaults to normal health, set `chimerical` to True for chimerical healing.
- `/avct reset_eligible <character>`  
  Reset all eligible counters (with `is_resettable=True`) for a character.

### Adding Predefined Counters with `/configav add counter`

You can add predefined counters to your character using the following command:

```
/configav add counter <character> <counter_type> <value> [comment] [item_or_project_name]
```

**Predefined counter types you can pick from:**

- `item_with_charges` *(requires `item_or_project_name`)*
- `project_roll` *(requires `item_or_project_name`)*
- `Remove_When_Exhausted` *(requires `item_or_project_name`; counter is removed when value reaches 0)*
- `Reset_Eligible` *(requires `item_or_project_name`; counter can be reset to its perm value via `/avct reset_eligible`)*
- `willpower`
- `mana`
- `blood_pool`
- `willpower_fae`
- `glamour`
- `nightmare`
- `banality`
- `glory`
- `honor`
- `wisdom`
- `rage`
- `gnosis`

**Usage notes:**
- For `item_with_charges`, `project_roll`, `Remove_When_Exhausted`, and `Reset_Eligible`, you must provide a name for the counter in `item_or_project_name`.
- For `glory`, `honor`, `wisdom`, you can use `item_or_project_name` to override the counter name.
- `Remove_When_Exhausted` counters are automatically removed when their value reaches 0.
- `Reset_Eligible` counters can be reset to their perm value using `/avct reset_eligible`.

**Examples:**
```
/configav add counter MyCharacter willpower 5
/configav add counter MyCharacter item_with_charges 3 "Magic Sword"
/configav add counter MyCharacter Remove_When_Exhausted 1 "Potion"
/configav add counter MyCharacter Reset_Eligible 10 "Daily Power"
```

---

## Special Counter Types

- **Remove_When_Exhausted**: Counter is removed automatically when its value reaches 0.
- **Reset_Eligible**: Counter can be reset to its perm value via `/avct reset_eligible`.

---

## Categories

Counters are grouped by the following categories in output:

- **tempers**
- **reknown**
- **general**
- **health**
- **items**
- **other**
- **projects**
- **xp**

---

## Health System

- Health trackers store a list of health levels (Bruised, Hurt, Injured, Wounded, Mauled, Crippled, Incapacitated).
- **You can now add custom health levels to a character's health tracker using `/configav add health_level`.**
- Damage is tracked as a list of types (Bashing, Lethal, Aggravated).
- Damage and healing commands update the damage list, respecting health track limits.
- Normal and chimerical health trackers are displayed side by side when both exist.

### Health Display

Health is displayed using emoji:
- ‚óºÔ∏è - Empty/undamaged health level
- üáß - Bashing damage
- üá± - Lethal damage
- üá¶ - Aggravated damage

When both normal and chimerical health are present, a header row with üü¶ üá® indicates the columns.

---

## Counter Types

- **Single number**: Basic counter with temp and perm values
- **Perm is maximum**: Counter where temp can't exceed perm (used for willpower, etc.)
- **Perm is maximum with bedlam**: Counter with additional bedlam value (used for changeling willpower)
- **Perm not maximum**: Counter where temp and perm are tracked separately

### Counter Options

- `force_unpretty`: disables emoji formatting for this counter
- `is_resettable`: enables reset via `/avct reset_eligible`
- `is_exhaustible`: counter is removed when value reaches 0

---

## Autocomplete

All commands that take a character, counter, category, or splat use Discord dropdown/autocomplete for fast selection.

---

## Notes

- All data is per-user; users cannot see or edit other users' characters or counters.
- Removing a character also removes all associated counters and health trackers.
- All limits (max characters, counters, field lengths) are configurable in `.env`.
- Health display automatically pairs normal and chimerical health when both exist.
